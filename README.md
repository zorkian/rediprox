Rediprox - the caching, sharding Redis proxy

This is a project for me to learn Rust. This is terrible, unidiomatic
code, mostly just me fighting with the borrow checker and all those
memes.

I'm posting this to Github to be able to track the changes and ask
people for feedback.

Don't use this in production or in any place you care about your data.

Do feel free to comment about the code though!
